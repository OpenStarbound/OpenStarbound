# humanoidConfig

---

## `Vec2F` headRotationCenter
The rotation center for the head, in pixels, default is `[0,-2]`

---

## `String` `JsonObject` animation
Is an optional string path or a JsonObject for an animation config, if it is defined the humanoid will use the networked animator for its animations instead of the entirely hardcoded humanoid animations.

The animation must contain these transformation groups as they are used for some hardcoded behavior that happens locally to the client.
- `headRotation`
- `backCosmetic<slot>Rotation` for slots 1-20
- `frontArmRotation`
- `backArmRotation`
- `personalityHeadOffset`
- `personalityArmOffset`

The animation must contain these stateTypes and states for some hardcoded behavior that happens locally to the client.
- `bodyDance`
    - `idle` set whenever the player/npc is not dancing or the dance step does not define a body frame
    - `dance` the default dance state set if the stateType does not contain a state matching the name of the body dance frame for the dance step
- `backArmDance`
    - `idle` set whenever the player/npc is not dancing or the dance step does not define a back arm frame
    - `dance` the default dance state set if the stateType does not contain a state matching the name of the back arm dance frame for the dance step
- `frontArmDance`
    - `idle` set whenever the player/npc is not dancing or the dance step does not define a front arm frame
    - `dance` the default dance state set if the stateType does not contain a state matching the name of the front arm dance frame for the dance step
- `backHandItem`
    - `inside` set when the held item is inside the hand
    - `outside` set when the held item is outside the hand
- `frontHandItem`
    - `inside` set when the held item is inside the hand
    - `outside` set when the held item is outside the hand
- `frontArm`
    - `idle` set when arm is not holding an item
    - `rotation` the default animation when holding an item and the stateType does not contain a state matching the name of the front arm rotation frame
- `backArm`
    - `idle` set when arm is not holding an item
    - `rotation` the default animation when holding an item and the stateType does not contain a state matching the name of the back arm rotation frame

All other animation data is entirely configurable.

For example, in the hardcoded humanoid animations, things like `walkBob` and `armWalkSeq` must be used and always behave in the same way, but in `/humanoid/opensb/build.lua` They are used to generate animation frame properties that imitate how retail used them, though this it not required, as the build script could do anything with its output.

## `JsonObject` stateAnimations
Each key must be a humanoid state `idle`, `walk`, `run`, `jump`, `fall`, `swim`, `swimIdle`, `duck`, `sit`, `lay` for a JsonObject that will control what animation states defined in the animation config are triggered when each state is triggered, this is so that when connecting to a retail server, these animations will trigger locally on your client.
here is an example
```
"stateAnimations" : {
    "idle" : {
        "body" : ["idle"]
    },
    "walk" : {
        "body" : ["walk"]
    }
}
```
`body` there being the name of a stateType in the animation, and `idle` being one of its states, one can also add additional args that are equivalent to calling `animator.setLocalAnimationState`

## `JsonObject` stateAnimationsBackwards
Same as `stateAnimations` but for when the player is moving backwards.
here is an example.
```
"stateAnimations" : {
    "idle" : {
        "body" : ["idle"]
    },
    "walk" : {
        "body" : ["walk", false, true]
    }
}
```
Note the additional arguments supplied to `setLocalAnimationState` in this example so that the walk animation will play backwards.

## `JsonObject` emoteAnimations
Same as `stateAnimations`, but instead triggers for humanoid emote states, `idle`, `blabber`, `shout`, `happy`, `sad`, `neutral`, `laugh`, `annoyed`, `oh`, `oooh`, `blink`, `wink`, `eat`, `sleep`

## `JsonObject` portraitAnimations
Same as `stateAnimations`, but instead triggers for portrait mode states, `head`, `bust`, `full`, `fullNeutral`, `fullNude`, `fullNeutralNude`
These are never triggered on the player/npc in world, but instead in the animator instanced for portraits.

## `List<String>` animationScripts
Client side animation scripts to be paired with the animation, does not need an animation to be defined to function.
Gets uninitialized and initialized with new scripts when the humanoid instance is refreshed.
